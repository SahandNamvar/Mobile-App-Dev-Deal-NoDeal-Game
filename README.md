# Deal or No Deal Mobile App Game (Java Edition)

Welcome to the Deal or No Deal mobile app game, developed in Android Studio using JAVA.

## How to Play

1. **Starting with 10 Suitcases:** Each player begins the game with 10 closed suitcases, each concealing a reward.

2. **Opening Cases:** In the first round, players open up to 4 cases, revealing the corresponding dollar amounts. Once a case is opened, that deal is off the table.

3. **Decision Time:** After the first 4 cases are opened, player must make a decision â€“ to accept the current deal or to continue their quest for bigger rewards.

4. **Accept or Continue:** If they choose to accept the deal, victory is theirs! If they opt to continue, the journey unfolds with the opening of another set of 4 cases.

5. **Final Round:** In the last and third round, players must make a final decision by choosing only 1 suitcase, leaving them with no option but to claim the prize behind the unopened case.

## Prize Calculation

The total prize is calculated by taking 60% of the average value of the unopened cases, adding an element of strategy and anticipation to the game.
